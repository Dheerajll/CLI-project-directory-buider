# CLI-project-directory-buider
This is a basic CLI tool build using the standard python library like subprocess, pathlib and parsearg.
What this tool does:
1. Creates a project folder
2. Initializes the folder with readme.md and requirement.txt
3. Creates a .gitignore
4. Creates a virtual environment
With further changes and adding more feature it can be a pretty handy tool for developers.
